# 🌞 Daily scripts

In this repository I store some scripts that I use in my day-to-day work.

## 🗃️ Content
- Day-to-day notes
- Scripts for data handling
- Performance analysis
- Replication
- Maintenance
- Best practices

## 🛠️ Tested versions
Since this is part of my work scope, most of the scripts were tested and executed using MySQL:

- MySQL 5.7
- MySQL 8.0

## 🥇 Golden tip
Always run a `SELECT` before an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, and always start a transaction before making any changes.
